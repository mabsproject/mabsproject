Once you have the lot take a lot of time to visit and daydream.  Look at all of the views, walk around the property and walk around the neighborhood.  Start imagining what you want your house to look like and how you want the view both from inside and outside to be.  

Take as much time as you can without impacting when you want to complete your project.
