In the heart of Seattle finding land is not an easy process.  In most cases the land you can purchase will include a house.  If you are building new a house on the land is really just in the way and an extra cost to your overall project.  The good news is that land will already include some utilities and can be an offset to the cost of tearing down the house.  For example it costs about $45k to tear a house down and remove all of the debris.  For new utility hookups (sewer, water, electricity) you are looking at about the same costs from the county to permit and connect.  Plus you need to pay a contractor to do the work on top of that.  So that is a wash.

But land without a house is significantly less expensive than land with a house.  There is no offset for this cost and will need to be accounted for in the overall project cost.  This is important because you will need to have two types of loans.  

1.  A building loan
2.  A home loan
-----------

1.  **A building loan:**  When you start building a bank will give you a line of credit to purchase goods and pay for milestones in the project.
2.  **A home loan:**  Once the entire project is complete you need to pay off the building loan with a home loan based on that assessed value of the new house.  This needs to take into account all of the previous loans you took out to purchase the property.  So when the house is assessed you are looking for an assessor who can get it to 2x build cost.  This way with the land purchase price plus the build cost you will be just over 80% equity in the home to avoid any PMI or other bank fees.

So keep in mind that all of the costs for the project add up to the final home loan amount!
