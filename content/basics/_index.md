### Why Build?

# We really need more room

Seattle is a very dense and populated city. Land is hard to find and when you do find it King County has a lot of rules on how you can build.  We have learned over the last few years that building new is not for everyone and if you decide to go this route be prepared to spend a lot of time on the project.  

This will be our place to document everything we go through including each phase of the project, expected timeline versus reality and the costs associated.

We hope you enjoy and this helps you in making your decision of to build or not to build!
